            By integrating these approaches, MegaLands aims to uncover how megalithic landscapes influenced and were influenced by the ecological and cultural dynamics of the Neolithic societies. This research will offer groundbreaking insights into the environmental context and the spatial organization of megalithic landscapes in NW Iberia, shedding fresh insights into the daily lives and monumental legacies of Neolithic communities in Atlantic Europe and beyond.
