# STUDY AREAS
{% capture formats %}
<span class="term">Serra da Capelada:</span> The Capelada-Coriscada mountain complex hosts one of the most numerous tumulus and megalithic assemblages in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, with over a hundred tumuli scattered across the Faladoira, Coriscada, and Capelada mountain ranges. Our current database indicates that Serra da Capelada contains a group of approximately 30 tumular monuments located on elevated peneplains, near transit areas.

<span class="term">Serra do Leboreiro:</span> This region represents the most continental area of those studied within this project and is renowned for its significant concentration of tumular and megalithic dolmens. Recent remote sensing analyses with technologies like LiDAR (Canedo et al. 2024) allowed the identification of ca. 200 megalithic monuments, greatly increasing the number of sites, based on field surveys and prospections.

<span class="term">Costa da Morte:</span> Costa da Morte stands out as one of the areas in Galicia with the highest density of megalithic mounds (ca. 400) (Carrero-Pazos et al. 2019). Several tombs are among the most renowned sites of the Galician megalithic complex, such as Dombate, Parxubeira or Casa dos Mouros.

<span class="term">Xistral Mountains:</span> The Xistral mountains represent an absolute hotspot in terms of palaeoenvironmental knowledge. The extent and age of their peatlands (some covering the whole Holocene period) favoured the intense palaeoenvironmental work has been undertaken in the area since the late 1990s, both from a geochemical and a palynological perspective (e.g., Martínez-Cortizas et al. 2002; Mighall et al. 2006, 2023).

<span class="term">Penausén-Idarga Sierras:</span> The Necropolis of Penausén-Calabazos is composed by a total of eleven monuments (Rodríguez del Cueto, Carrero Pazos 2021).

# WORKING PACKAGES
# WP1: Spatial data and field prospection (SO1)
- T1.1. Assisted detection with AI: Application of an AI-assisted decision making system for detecting megalithic sites through LiDAR datasets. Ground-truthing through field surveys to quantitatively validate the results of the AI-assisted predictions and further improve the model's accuracy.
- T1.2. Fieldwork prospection to check and record the new detected sites.

# WP2: Megalith on-site test-pits sampling and analyses (SO2, SO3)
- T2.1. GPR prospection: GPR prospection will be used together with other archaeological features to identify, at a site scale, the best places to conduct further archaeological work.
- T2.2. Archaeological intervention (test pits) and on-site sampling in selected megalithic sites: test pits will be excavated at every of the five working regions. Further sampling for chronometric dating, geoarchaeology and palynology will be performed on test pits.
- T2.3. Chronometric dating: by Optically Stimulated Luminescence profiling and dating (OSL-PD) and AMS radiocarbon dating, if required.
- T2.4. Geoarchaeological analysis: to understand archaeological site dynamics at the time of megalith construction and thereafter.
- T2.5. Palynological Analysis: to study vegetation change at a very local scale (few meters) in relation to megalith position.

# WP3: Peatland Off-site palaeoenvironmental analyses (SO3)
- T3.1. Off-site peat sampling: new palaeoenvironmental records in Serra da Capelada and Leboreiro.
- T3.2. Radiocarbon dating and age-depth modelling to stablish peat sequences chronologies at Serra da Capelada and Leboreiro.
- T3.3. Geochemical Analysis: to study climatic and anthropogenic forcings on the Earth system derived from processes such as soil erosion or minerometallurgical activity at Serra da Capelada and Leboreiro.
- T3.4. Palynological Analysis: to study climatic and anthropogenic forcings on vegetation, as well as subsistence practices and fire history at the near vicinities of the megalithic monuments (few Km) at Serra da Capelada and Leboreiro.

# WP4: Data modelling and results integration (SO2, SO3, SO4)
- T4.1. Landscape analysis and locational modelling of megalithic sites: Use of GIS and geographical modelling (e.g., Geographically Weighted Regression) to analyse spatial patterns.
- T4.2. Temporal models of megalithic sites: Create Bayesian chronological models using existing and newly obtained dates.
- T4.3. Integrative models of archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data. Approaching the environmental conditions and subsistence practices related to the megalithic sites.

# WP5: Dissemination and transfer actions (see 4.3., 4.4., 4.5.)
- T5.1. Design and launch the website of the project.
- T5.2. GIS web app: Design of a web-app using CESGA’s Peneira framework, to integrate the archaeological sites studied in the project and the peatbogs analysed.
- T.5.3. Working meetings: online at the beginning and during the Project, in presence at final stages, as a closing seminar for the project.
- T5.4. Informative talks for the general public at the selected megalithic sites. General talks carried out at the 5 selected regions to trigger public attention.
- T5.5. Project reports and scientific papers drafting.
- T5.6. Preparation and publication of results at national and international conferences.
- T5.7. Organization and celebration of a symposium on the megalithic phenomenon in NW Iberia.
