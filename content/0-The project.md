## MEGALITHIC LANDSCAPES: EXPLORING HUMAN-ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS OF NEOLITHIC SOCIETIES IN NORTHWESTERN IBERIA (5TH–2ND MILLENNIUM BCE) (MegaLands)

{% include figure.html img="pedra_arca.jpg" alt="MegaLands" %}

MegaLands is a Knowledge-Generation Project, Non-Oriented Modality (Type A), led by two Principal Investigators and supported by a multidisciplinary team. It is aimed at generating and significantly advancing the scientific knowledge and high-quality, well-validated research. The Project PIs are Miguel Carrero-Pazos (USC) and Noemí Silva-Sánchez (USC).

MegaLands aims to increase the generation of high-quality scientific knowledge, fostering a deeper understanding of megalithic societies in NW Iberia, through innovative multidisciplinary approaches that address critical gaps in spatial, chronological, and palaeoenvironmental data. 

The General Objective (GO) of the project is:

{% capture usecase %}
<span class="term">General Objective</span> - To increase our understanding of the megalithic societies in Northwestern Iberia through a holistic approach, considering both their social and environmental dimensions.
#### SO1. To refine available spatial data of NW Iberian megaliths through artificial intelligence.
#### SO2. To contribute to fill the available gaps in the chronological knowledge about the megalithic phenomenon in NW Iberia, providing new detailed, more refined chronometric datasets in comparative regions.
#### SO3. To reconstruct the environmental conditions and subsistence practices (agriculture, livestock, burning, etc.) of megalithic landscapes through a combination of a multiproxy (geochemistry and palynology) and using a multiscale (on-site and off-site) approach.
#### SO4. To generate comparative models of the distribution of megalithic tombs in the Iberian Northwest, identifying regional location patterns and assessing their correspondence with environmental and geographical factors.

## Starting hypothesis
MegaLands arises from the starting hypotheses that the spatial distribution of NW Iberian megalithic monuments reflects deliberate landscape use and settlement strategies influenced by environmental and ecological factors, including periods of environmental change.

{% capture formats %}
<span class="term">a: Data quality and cataloguing</span> existing archaeological records require updating to address inaccuracies, duplication, and inconsistent documentation.

<span class="term">b: Chronological gaps</span> The 103 radiocarbon dates from 56 NW Iberian monuments are insufficient to establish a robust timeline, necessitating new dating programs.

<span class="term">c: Palaeoenvironmental data representativity</span> most of available palaeoenvironmental information comes from the highlands, so increasing data availability in the lowlands will allow a better understanding of the megalithic phenomenon diversity within NW Iberia.

<span class="term">d: Data integration</span> spatial models of megalithic monuments published up-to-date focus on geographical trends, but no effort has been made to integrate palaeoenvironmental data.
{% endcapture %}
{% include card.html text=formats header="Starting hypothesis" %}

MegaLands builds on the above-described state of the art by integrating spatial, environmental and new chronometric data, to provide a revised understanding of the NW Iberian megalithic complex.

Moving beyond traditional descriptive approaches, it aligns with calls for holistic studies that integrate human agency and environmental changes. By addressing whether ecological and climatic changes influenced megalithic monument construction, the project avoids deterministic frameworks, proposing nuanced explanations of human-environment dynamics.
